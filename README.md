# Real-time-Weather-Data-Analysis-using-Kafka-and-PySpark-

A motivating problem in human civilization is weather forecasting. The complicated phenomena known as weather includes the dynamic interplay of many factors. Numerous numerical weather models and algorithms have been created and put into use to forecast the weather. In many different disciplines, including agriculture, government planning, industry, stock analysis, etc., weather forecasting is extremely important. Every day, a variety of sensors are placed in various geographic places to gather meteorological data.

In this project, we receive and store the real time data using Kafka for data ingestion, MongoDB as the database and perform stream processing using Apache Spark. The real time data is analysed and is shown on a dashboard using the front-end technologies.
